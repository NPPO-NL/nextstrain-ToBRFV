Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a Tobamovirus that was first observed in 2014 and 2015 on tomato plants in Israel and Jordan respectively. Since the first description, the virus has been reported from all continents except Oceania and Antarctica, and has been found infecting both tomato and pepper crops.

This Nextstrain build contains (near) complete ToBRFV genome sequences from materials collected at production locations and during phytosanitary inspections. A [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ivJ3cJmj0BI) is available explaining the use of the ToBRFV Nextstrain build page. 

### A community effort
Sharing data with this interactive online tool will enable the plant virology field to better understand and communicate the diversity and spread of this virus. Organizations are invited to share data or materials for inclusion in the build. Updates will be communicated via Resource Announcements to which contributing organizations are invited as co-author.


### Contribute to the build
The reliability of a track and trace tool depends on sampling and metadata completeness. You can contribute to the build by providing plant materials, RNA or assembled (near) complete ToBRFV sequences together with relevant metadata to the Netherlands Institute for Vectors, Invasive plants and Plant health (NIVIP) (formerly: National Reference Centre for Plant Health, which is part of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Safety Authority [(NVWA)](https://english.nvwa.nl). On the NVWA website, a generic [form](https://english.nvwa.nl/about-us/contact) is available to get in touch in case you'd like to contribute to the build.


### Versions
[**31 December 2019**](https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/ToBRFV/20191231)

Shows 63 genomic sequences from nine countries from materials sampled between November 2014 and November  2019. Includes information on hosts and materials sampled, (anonymized) rootstock and scion varieties, and within-isolate variation is provided. The first version of the Nextstrain build was created with Augur export v1.


[**6 December 2020**](https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/ToBRFV/20201206)

Shows 118 genomic sequences from 15 countries from materials sampled between November 2014 and October 2020. New information on rootstock and scion seed origin is provided, and major clades have been defined. The second version of the Nextstrain build was created with Augur export v2.

[**12 April 2022**](https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/ToBRFV/20211223)

Shows 179 genomic sequences from 16 countries from materials sampled between November 2014 and November 2021. The third version of the Nextstrain build was created with Augur export v2. A rapid expansion of clade 7 samples were observed.

[**5 February 2024**](https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/ToBRFV/20240205)
Shows 336 genomic sequences from 23 countries from materials sampled between November 2014 and December 2023.
